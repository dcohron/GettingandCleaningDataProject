\ Code Description:{
The script run_analysis.r does the following:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
    variable for each activity and each subject.


All code is annotated in the run_analysis.r script.

This below will walk through the methodology of the script as remarked in the file itself:
1) Load the libraries that will be used later in the script.
2) Name the files for subsequent loading by assigning the file locations to variables.
3) Read in the intial data files to begin reassembling the main file from the parts- test (x, y and sub):
    This was a bit of a puzzle and really had to look at each of the files and the data therein to see 
    how each component would fit with the entire data frame. This involved matching the dimensions of the 
    data.frames to determine how they would fit together.
4) From features.txt we see that the data are variable names.  Must convert from factor to character and
    assign to column names of the main file.
5) From main we can produce mainreduced as we subset on variables that contain mean and standard deviations.
    This reduces the data frame from 563 variables to a more manageable 89.
6) Then we can clear memory of the data frames that we are no longer using which speeds up processing.
7) Now we need to convert names back to factors so that we can group by activity and subject
8) This is a good point to clean up the variable names used as column names in the data frame.
    I found the variable names to be fairly clear, although a bit long and unwieldy.  I cleaned 
    them up by removing "." and "()-" because these were in many names and were untidy.
9) Now the mainreduced data frame is ready to be grouped by activity and subject and using the pipeline
    operator "%>%" feed into summary_each to calculate the mean of each column.  This produced a data frame
    with 180 observations (rows) on the same 89 variables (columns) which saves in tidymain.
10) Last is to write tidymain out to a text file "tidydate.txt"
